    <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient
        list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h4>Lasagna Ingredients</h4>

        ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Meat: </b>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><b>Onion and garlic: </b>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
        </li>
        <li><b>Tomato products: </b>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of
            tomato paste.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar: </b>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li><b>Spices and seasonings:</b>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt,
            Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Lasagna noodles: </b>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li><b>Cheeses: </b>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs: </b>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h4>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
        <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>How to Layer Lasagna</h4>
    <p>The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but this is the order you'll follow: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Meat sauce</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Ricotta mixture</li>
        <li>Mozzarella slices</li>

    </ol>
    <h4>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h4>
    <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with
        foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let
        the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.</p>

        Lasagna for delicious serving inspiration. These are a few of the recipes you'll find:</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>How to Reheat Lasagna</h3>
    <p>You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, but be aware that it will
        change the texture of the noodles. The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers
        with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is
        bubbly.</p>
    <h3>How to Freeze Lasagna</h3>
    <p>If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil baking dish. Allow the casserole to cool,
        then cover the whole thing in at least one layer of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent
        freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months.</p>
    <h4>How to Reheat Frozen Lasagna</h4>
    <p>Thaw the frozen lasagna in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the reheating instructions above. If you don't
        have time to thaw in the fridge, you can reheat it from frozen — just make sure to add a few minutes to the cook
        time to ensure the dish is heated through.</p>
